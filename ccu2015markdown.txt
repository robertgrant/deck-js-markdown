t Can interactive data visualisation help us communicate uncertainty?
a Robert Grant, Kingston &amp; St. George&apos;s
-
h Why? 
o To give an overview
o To convey scale and complexity
o To explore the data and comparisons therein
o To communicate information
o To tell a story
o To attract attention and stimulate interest
p (objectives proposed by <a href="http://eagereyes.org/blog/2012/responses-gelman-unwin-convenient-posting">Gelman &amp; Unwin 2013</a>)
p Conclusion: one image is not enough

h Interactive
u delivered (constructed) in the web browser
u can click or hover for more info
u can filter to interesting data
u can zoom to interesting regions
w other tricks like transparency and animation are available
-
h Example one
i 400 w stateofobesity.png
p <a href="http://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/">stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity</a>
-
h Interactive
u involve the viewer in finding their own relevant story
u let them drill down to the level of detail they want
u can guide them into a complex message
w prolegomena
w annotation

h Example two

h Interactive
u statisticians and designers encountering one another
u innovation vs "style over substance", maybe public vs private sector
u see <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2146416">Heer and Scheiderman's "Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analysis"</a> for a proposed taxonomy
-
h Anatomy of webpages
u HTML file: a recipe that the browser follows
u CSS for formatting
u JavaScript for programming (including interactivity)
u SVG vector graphics
u you can view the source code for any web page
-
h JavaScript libraries
u <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> is only two years old but dominates the interactive scene
u attach your data to the webpage and use the values to control the page content (like text or SVG)
u users can filter, select the data, and the webpage is updated accordingly
u Nick Qi Zhu's "Data Visualization with D3.js Cookbook" is excellent
u <a href="http://www.d3noob.org">d3noob.org</a> is a pretty good starting place too
u <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> is a popular and lightweight JavaScript library for mapping - much easier to learn than D3!
u there are other libraries (vis, raphael) but none as flexible as D3

h A D3 page
p <a href="simple-d3.html"><img src="simple-d3.png" height="600"></a>

h Or avoid the JS entirely
u <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts">rCharts</a> will translate R lattice code to HTML+JS (not D3)
u <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv/rMaps">rMaps</a> or <a href="http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/software">R2leaflet / Stata2leaflet</a> likewise for maps
u I'm also building <a href="http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/software">Stata2D3</a>, which uses standard graph commands
u <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a> has limited options and relies on server-side R
u <a href="http://ggvis.rstudio.com/">ggvis</a> takes ggplot2 code and translates to Shiny
u <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery">Google spreadsheets</a>
u Excel web app (<a href="https://office.com/start/default.aspx">Office Online</a>)

u this is all very nice, but depictions of uncertainty are rare

h The challenge
u can&apos;t assume we can show all CIs, posterior draws or whatever (ink saturation)
w ...but transparency helps a <em>lot</em>
u not everyone wants to see every (or even any) CI
u can&apos;t assume people understand dichotomous things like CIs
w overlap intervals could help (<a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmm/migrated/documents/graphical-presentation-of-a-collection-of-means.pdf">Goldstein &amp; Healey 1995</a>)
w but I like draws from the posterior or sampling distribution best
w you can propagate different sources of uncertainty
w and give the option to show CI / convex hull

h Example five Fisher's irises?
-
h Some uncertainty options
u animate a series of posterior/bootstrap draws
u show CI / distribution on click or hover
u highlight significantly different data on click or hover
u highlight number of posterior draws meeting certain criteria (heading towards a p-value)
-
h Considerations: comprehension
u don&apos;t confuse a collection of data and a collection of posterior draws
u choose one style and set of tools and stick with it
u offer an exemplar
-
h Considerations: confidentiality
u interactive visualisation usually means putting the data on the website
u you could limit access through Flash or just a selection of fixed images
u but remember graphs with individual data points already publish your data
-
h Considerations: future proofing
u if you rely on proprietary JS or background images like map tiles, they might be gone one day
u likewise APIs to obtain content from servers
u the safest approach is to use open-source content, software and JS, and store it locally
